# ACLED Link Analysis

Supervised Link Prediction with the Armed Conflict Location Event Database
In this notebook, I will be turning relational data from the Armed Conflict
Location & Event Data Project and turning it into several "Conflict"
Undirected Graphs/Networks.

## Navigation
First view notebook_feature_engineering.ipynb then notebook_modelling.ipynb <br>
Code is available as a python executable as well, but you must source the data first

## Todo
Dockerize + Condaize this project
